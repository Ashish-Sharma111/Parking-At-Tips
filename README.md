## DESCRIPTION :
  * THIS WEBSITE WILL PROVIDE FACILITY TO FIND PARKING AREA AND BOOK THE ONLINE  PARKING SLOTS CLOSE TO USER DESTINATION.
  * LEVERAGING POWER OF JAVA,SPRINGBOOT,REACTJS AND MYSQL, THIS PROJECT AIMS TO PROVIDE USER-FRIENDLY WEBSITE AND EFFICIENT SOLUTION FOR PARKINGS IN METROPOLITIANÂ CITIES.
## Frontend (HTML and React):
## Homepage:

* Display a user-friendly interface with an overview of available parking spaces.
* Include a search bar for users to find parking spaces in specific areas.
## Parking Map:

* Utilize a map component (you can use tools like Google Maps API or Leaflet) to display available parking spots in real-time.
* Highlight occupied and available parking spaces with different colors or markers.
## User Registration/Login:

* Implement a user authentication system using React.
* Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles.
## Booking System:

* Allow users to select available parking spots and book them.
* Provide a calendar or date/time picker for booking durations.
## Reservation History:

* Display a history of previous parking reservations for each user.
## Notifications:

* Implement a notification system to alert users about successful bookings, upcoming reservations, or payment reminders.
## Backend (Java and C#):
RESTful API:

* Develop a backend API using Java (Spring Boot) and C# (.NET Core).
* Endpoints for user registration, login, parking spot availability, booking, and history.
## Database Integration (SQL):

* Use SQL databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to store user data, parking spot information, and reservation history.
* Create tables for users, parking spots, and reservations.
## Authentication and Authorization:

* Implement a secure authentication mechanism for user login and registration.
* Ensure that only authenticated users can access certain endpoints.
## Business Logic:

* Manage the logic for checking parking spot availability, making reservations, and updating the database accordingly.
## Payment Integration (Optional):

* If you want to incorporate a payment system, integrate a payment gateway.
## Database (SQL):
#### Users Table:

* Fields: UserID, Username, Password, Email, etc.
#### Parking Spots Table:

* Fields: SpotID, Location, Availability Status, etc.
## Reservations Table:

* Fields: ReservationID, UserID (foreign key), SpotID (foreign key), StartTime, EndTime, Status, etc.
## Integration:
#### Connect Frontend with Backend:

* Use HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT) to communicate between the React frontend and the Java (Spring Boot) and C# (.NET Core) backend.
## Database Connection:

* Utilize JDBC (Java) and ADO.NET (C#) to connect the backend with the SQL database.
## Testing:

* Test the integration to ensure that data flows correctly between the frontend, backend, and database.
* Remember to secure sensitive information such as database credentials and API keys. Additionally, consider implementing error handling and validation to enhance the robustness of your system.
